 <!--This is an orderd list--> 
<ol>
    <li><p>Exfoliation:</p> There are 2 different types of exfoliant: chemical and physical. 
        Each one helps to buff away dead skin cells, but they work in 2 different ways. 
        Chemical exfoliants work by using a blend of Alpha-Hydroxy Acids, 
        which dissolve away dirt, oil and impurities. Physical exfoliants use small grains that when rubbed into the skin, manually remove dirt and grime. </li>
    <li><p>Cleanse Regularly:</p> Cleansing is a clear way to beautiful skin.
        Not only does it help to remove the makeup from the day, but it also removes all dirt, oil and impurities so your skin can actually repair itself overnight. 
        That is of course, when you double cleanse. A single cleanse unfortunately just isn’t strong enough to remove all the grime from your skin.
        Using an oil-based cleanser to start will attract all the oil from your skin, and then your second cleanse can be used to actually deep clean your pores. </li>
    <li><p>Drink plenty of water:</p> Water is perhaps the most important and glow-inducing ingredient for your skin.
        If you don’t keep your cells hydrated, they won’t be healthy, and you will have a very dull and fatigued complexion.
        Drinking at least 2 litres of water a day will not only help to keep your skin moisturised but will also flush out toxins from your system, so they don’t build up in your cells.
        An alternative is fruit infused water such as Strawberries, Lemons and Apples, and limes which all add flavour and nutrients without the extra additives. </li>
    <li><p>Hydration is key:</p> "Lack of hydration makes your complexion dull and even accentuates wrinkles," says Jeanine Downie, M.D., a dermatologist at Image Dermatology in Montclair, New Jersey.
        "Apply a topical moisturizer morning and evening to replenish hydration."</li>
    <li><p>Exercise:</p> Exercise is such an easy way to get glowing skin as the increase in heart rate pushes blood around the body and encourages the removal of toxins.
        By doing just 30 minutes of exercise 3 times a week, you will soon notice an improvement in the health of your complexion, as well as in your overall mood and energy levels too.</li>
