<h3> Acne </h3>
<p> Constituting by blackheads, cysts and nodules as well as pimples and white heads, Acne is the most common skin disorder in mainly in teens but also common in adults.

</p>
<ul>

<h4> Rosacea </h4>
<p> Rosacea is a chronic swelling of the face, with redness, prominent blood vessels, and pimples.
    Rosacea is most common in women over 30, but men can be affected too. Problems with the immune system, vein problems and/or environmental issues can cause the condition. 
    Depending upon the symptoms, there are several effective treatments: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Antibiotics, such as metronidazole cream or oral doxycycline can be used</li>
    <li>Azelaic acid gel (Finacea), a naturally occurring saturated dicarboxylic acid, can be used for the inflamed pimples</li>
    <li>For more severe cases, your doctor might suggest the acne drug isotretinoin</li>
    <li>Beta blockers can also be used to reduce flushing, using the smallest dose of oestrogen possible,
        or laser or surgical treatments may also reduce redness. </li>
</ul>

<h5> Eczema</h5>
<p> Atopic dermatitis (eczema) most commonly seen in children is assumed to be the result of genetics, the environment, and/or the immune system but the exact cause is still unknown. 
    Dry, scaly and itchy skin are the norm, and constant scratching may lead to a thickened area.
    While eczema often occurs in people with allergies, allergies do not cause eczema. 
    Topical steroids are often used to lessen symptoms.
